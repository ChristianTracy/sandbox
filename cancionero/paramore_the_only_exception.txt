When i was younger 
I saw my daddy cry 
And cursed at the wind 
He broke his own heart 
And i watched 
As he tried to reassemble it 

And my momma swore that 
She would never let herself forget 
And that was the day i promised 
Id never sing of love 
If it does not exist 

But darlin, 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 
You, are, the only exception 

Maybe i know, somewhere 
Deep in my soul 
That love never lasts 
And we've got to find other ways 
To make it alone 
Or keep a straight face
